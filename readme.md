The program is a Country Name and Capitals Guessing game that dynamically updates through a Rest API. The program works by getting the players input regarding the game mode, then depending on if they have played the game before in that session downloading from the API the list of Country Names or the list of Capitals. When the player is guessing countries they will input their guess, and if the guess is not in the list that was downloaded earlier they will lose a life, otherwise they will get a point. The program keeps a track of the total points scored throughout the time playing the game and lets the user know of their overall high score for both of the modes when they choose to exit the game.
